title: Getting Started
---

Are you ready to start a TypeScript project that will be automatically converted to Lua? This page will help you get started.

Note that we assume that you are already familiar with how TypeScript works. If you have never coded a project in TypeScript before, or you need a refresher, first read the [official TypeScript tutorial](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html).

## Installation

TypeScriptToLua is built using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and distributed via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). To install it, you need to create a `package.json` file in the root of your project, containing at least `{}`. Then, you can add the latest version of TypeScriptToLua to your project:

```bash
# If you use npm:
npm install --save-dev typescript-to-lua

# If you use yarn:
yarn add --dev typescript-to-lua

# If you use pnpm:
pnpm add --save-dev typescript-to-lua
```

(If you don't know the difference between the package managers, choose `npm`.)

:::note
Installing `tstl` locally is recommended to keep your build reproducible and prevent version conflicts between projects. However, it is also possible to install it globally with `npm install --global typescript-to-lua`.
:::

## Project setup

TypeScriptToLua is configured using a `tsconfig.json` file. (This is the same file used to configure vanilla TypeScript.) It should be located in your project's root.

### Basic Configuration

```json title=tsconfig.json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TypeScriptToLua/TypeScriptToLua/master/tsconfig-schema.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ESNext",
    "lib": ["ESNext"],
    "moduleResolution": "Node",
    "types": [],
    "strict": true
  },
  "tstl": {
    "luaTarget": "JIT"
  }
}
```

If your target Lua environment is not [LuaJIT](https://luajit.org/), make sure to change the value of `luaTarget`. Valid values are `JIT`, `5.3`, `5.2`, `5.1`, `5.0`, and `universal`.

:::note
You can find out the version of your Lua environment by running: `print(_VERSION)`
:::

Check out [configuration page](configuration.md) for more information.

### Strictest Configuration

If you want the TypeScript compiler to be as strict as possible, then you need to enable some additional flags. Handily, we can extend from [the "strictest" TypeScript community config](https://github.com/tsconfig/bases/blob/main/bases/strictest.json) to abstract this away by adding this to top of the `tsconfig.json` file:

```json
  // We extend the strictest base config:
  // https://github.com/tsconfig/bases/blob/main/bases/strictest.json
  "extends": "@tsconfig/strictest/tsconfig.json",
```

## Building your project

Our command line interface is called `tstl` and it works almost exactly the same as TypeScript's `tsc`.

Since `tstl` is installed locally to your project, you cannot run it as a bare command in your terminal. Instead, use:

```bash
# If you use npm:
npx tstl

# If you use yarn (yarn also uses npx):
npx tstl

# If you use pnpm:
pnpm exec tstl
```

:::note
The binary is installed to `node_modules/.bin/tstl`, so you can also run it directly from that path if needed. (But this is not recommended.)
:::

### npm scripts

You can also run `tstl` as an [npm script](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts). Using npm scripts for this sort of thing is idiomatic in JavaScript/TypeScript projects. This is accomplished by adding a `scripts` field to the `package.json` file:

```json title=package.json
{
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tstl",
    "dev": "tstl --watch"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "typescript-to-lua": "..."
  }
}
```

Then, you can run the script like this:

```bash
# Build
npm run build

# Build and watch for changes
npm run dev
```

## Type Declarations

Using TypeScript instead of Lua is useful because everything plugs together in a verifiable way. With that in mind, `tstl` is not very useful unless you pair it with type declarations for your particular Lua environment. That way, TypeScript can catch the typos when you call some API function or use some API variable.

For instructions on how to install type declaration packages, see the readme file for the individual package in question. In short, you need to install the package from npm, and then add the following to your `tsconfig.json` file:

```json title=tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": ["foo"]
  }
}
```

### Type Declaration Packages - Official

We provide an official type declaration package for [the Lua standard library](https://github.com/TypeScriptToLua/lua-types).

These declarations do not come with `tstl` by default because most of the time, you should not be using the Lua standard library directly. In other words, you can just write idiomatic TypeScript and `tstl` will convert things properly. (For example, it converts `Math.round` to `math.round`.) However, if you want to do some low-level Lua stuff and work with the Lua standard library, then you will need to install these type declarations so that the TypeScript compiler can understand what you are doing.

### Type Declaration Packages - Unofficial

Type declarations exist for some common Lua environments:

- [Defold Game Engine](https://github.com/ts-defold/types)
- [LÃ–VE 2D Game Engine](https://github.com/hazzard993/love-typescript-definitions)

Additionally, type declarations exist for some games:

- [The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth](https://isaacscript.github.io)
- [Dota 2](https://github.com/ModDota/API/tree/master/declarations/server) ([template](https://github.com/ModDota/TypeScriptAddonTemplate))
- [Factorio](https://github.com/GlassBricks/typed-factorio)
- [Garry's Mod](https://github.com/lolleko/gmod-typescript)
- [Retro Gadget](https://github.com/DarkMio/retro-gadgets-typedefs) ([template](https://github.com/DarkMio/retro-gadgets-template))
- [World of Warcraft](https://github.com/wartoshika/wow-declarations)
- [World of Warcraft Classic](https://github.com/wartoshika/wow-classic-declarations)

(If you have created type declarations for a new game, you can click on the "Edit this page" link below to add it to the list.)
